# Deno OpenTelemetry

Welcome to the Deno [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) organization.

The goal of this organization is to build up a set of Deno modules that allow developers to use OTel in their Deno applications without having to use NPM modules.

It's currently a work in progress and PRs are welcomed from all comers.
